          <h2>Arabica</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Arabica beans are the most popular and widely consumed type of
              coffee
              bean, accounting for about 60-70% of the world's coffee
              production.
            </li>
            <li>Known for their smooth, mild flavor with a wide range of subtle
              and
              complex flavors, often including floral, fruity, and nutty notes.
            </li>
            <li>Typically have a lower caffeine content compared to other
              types,
              making them a preferred choice for those sensitive to caffeine.
            </li>
            <li>Grown at higher altitudes, usually above 2,000 feet, in cooler
              climates with ample rainfall and well-drained soil.</li>
            <li>Arabica plants are more susceptible to pests and diseases,
              requiring
              careful cultivation and maintenance.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="text-container">
          <h2>Robusta</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Robusta beans are known for their strong, bold flavor with
              earthy
              and
              woody notes, often accompanied by a slightly bitter taste.</li>
            <li>These beans have a higher caffeine content compared to Arabica
              beans,
              making them a popular choice for espresso blends and instant
              coffee.
            </li>
            <li>Robusta plants are more resilient and resistant to pests and
              diseases, thriving in lower altitudes, warmer climates, and less
              fertile soil.</li>
            <li>Are often grown in regions with consistent temperatures and
              rainfall,
              such as parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and Brazil.</li>
            <li>Typically cheaper to produce than Arabica beans due to their
              hardier
              nature and higher yields.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Liberica</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Liberica beans are one of the lesser-known and less commonly
              consumed
              types of coffee beans, representing a small fraction of the
              global
              coffee market.</li>
            <li>Have a distinctive flavor profile characterized by fruity and
              floral
              notes, often with a woody or smokey undertone.</li>
            <li>Are larger in size compared to Arabica and Robusta beans, with
              irregular shapes and asymmetrical cherries.</li>
            <li>Primarily grown in specific regions of West Africa, Southeast
              Asia,
              and the Philippines.</li>
            <li>Liberica plants are more resistant to certain pests and
              diseases
              compared to Arabica, but they require specific growing
              conditions,
              including high temperatures and humidity.</li>

          <h2>Excelsa</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Excelsa beans are less common and make up a smaller portion of
              the
              global coffee market compared to Arabica and Robusta.</li>
            <li>These beans are known for their unique flavor profile, which
              combines
              fruity and tart notes with a hint of smokiness and a touch of
              floral
              aroma.</li>
            <li>Excelsa beans are often used in specialty blends to add
              complexity
              and depth to the flavor profile.</li>
            <li>They are primarily grown in regions with high humidity and
              rainfall,
              such as parts of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines and
              Malaysia.</li>
            <li>Excelsa plants are relatively rare and have larger leaves and
              cherries compared to Arabica and Robusta plants.</li>
