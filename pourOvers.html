      <h1>Pour Overs</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>What Is A Pour Over?</h2>
      <p>A pour over is a manual brewing method that allows
        for a higher level of control over the resulting coffee.
        This method utilizes a cone which holds a filter and coffee grounds,
        in which hot water is slowly poured into in a sprial pattern over the
        grounds.
        The control over the resulting coffee's taste and strength can be
        adjusted by
        changing the water temperature, pouring speed, grind size, and more!
      </p>
      <p>This brewing technique differs from that of others like French Press
        by
        the extraction process. Pour Overs use a drip extraction, separated by
        a paper filter,
        whereas in a French Press, the grounds are steeped in water
        for a set amount of time, then is separated using a final metal mesh.
        Since the grounds are in contact with the water for a longer time,
        French Press is typically stronger than Pour Over coffee. French
        Presses also tend
        to be more grainer than Pour Overs because of the use of a metal mesh
        instead of a paper filter.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you prefer a lighter and cleaner finished coffee, a Pour Over is the
        way to go!

          <h3>Chemex</h3>
          <p> Chemex is a classic pour over dripper, having its distinguished
            hourglass body.
            The hourglass is great for heat retention, making it a good choice
            for larger batches of coffee.

          <h3>Melitta</h3>
          <p> A Melitta dripper is a simple and easy tool for Pour Overs. It is
            a small cone shaped dripper with
            a singular hole at the bottom. This dripper is usually found in
            plastic or ceramic, and has a spiral ribbed
            design similar to the Hario V60 design.

          <h3>Hario V60</h3>
          <p>A Hario V60 dripper is characterized by its spiral ribbed walls.
            This design allows for air flow while
            at the same time guiding the water, resulting in an optimal brewing
            process.

          <h3>Kalita Wave</h3>
          <p>A Kalita Wave dripper is as shown in the picture, usually found in
            stainless steel. This dripper
            design is unique in its design of 3 small holes at the bottom its
            flat bottom. The flat bottom and holes
            help ensure even saturation of the coffee grounds, and keeps the
            flow of water controlled.

      <h2>How To Make the Perfect Pour Over!</h2>
      <ol type='1'>
        <li>Make sure you are ready to begin brewing your Pour Over with all of
          the right
          materials. You will need a Pour Over cone, a filter, coffee grounds,
          a kettle, and your favorite mug!
        </li>
        <li>Grind size: in order for optimal extraction and avoiding
          bitterness, medium grind size is ideal.</li>
        <li>Water temperature: 195 - 205 degrees F is the range you should aim
          for so that you don't scald your coffee grounds.</li>
        <li>Coffee to Water Ratio: Typically, a 1:16 ratio of coffee to water
          is used. (Ex. 20 grams of coffee would require 320 grams of water)
        </li>
        <li>Brewing technique: Take your time when pouring the water over your
          grounds! This is where the flavor is made.
          Blooming is the first and a crucial part to the Pour Over method.
          Blooming is when the hot water is poured
          over the coffeee grounds and carbon dioxide is released, and the
          coffee swells. During this stage,
          double the amount of water to coffee should be used (Ex. if you have
          20 grams of coffee, pour 40 mL of hot water).
          After pouring the water, allow the bloom to settle for about 45
          seconds before continuing the brewing process
          with the rest of your water. The pouring method for the rest of your
          hot water should start in the middle,
          slowing working your way to the outer edges of the coffee grounds in
          a slow spiral motion.
          This method promotes an even and consistent extraction of the coffee
          grounds.
        </li>
        <li>Pour from kettle into your favorite mug and enjoy your delicious
          Pour Over coffee!</li>
