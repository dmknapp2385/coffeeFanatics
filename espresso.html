                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Grind Size:</strong> A fine grind similar
                            to confectionary sugar.</li>
                        <li><strong>Espresso Brew Ratio:</strong> Varies from
                            Ristretto (1:1) to Lungo (1:4).</li>
                        <li><strong>Water Temperature:</strong> Adjust
                            according to the roast level.</li>
                        <li><strong>Water:</strong> The quality of your water
                            is paramount.</li>
                        <li><strong>Coffee:</strong> Use freshly roasted beans
                            for optimal flavor.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="steps-container">
                <div class="step">
                    <h4>Step 1: Measure and Grind</h4>
                    <p>Start your espresso journey by measuring 18 grams of
                        freshly roasted coffee beans. Precision is key,
                        so
                        use a digital scale for accuracy. Next, grind your
                        beans to a fine consistency, akin to table salt.
                        The
                        grind should not be too coarse, as this will lead to a
                        fast and under-extracted shot, nor too fine,
                        which can cause over-extraction and bitterness.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h4>Step 2: Distribute and Tamp</h4>
                    <p>Transfer the ground coffee to your portafilter. Use a
                        distributor or a simple technique like the
                        Weiss
                        Distribution Technique (WDT) to evenly distribute the
                        grounds, eliminating any clumps and ensuring
                        an
                        even surface. Tamp with a firm, even pressure to create
                        a level bed of coffee. Aim for about 30
                        pounds
                        of pressure - you're looking for a smooth, flat surface
                        that will resist the pressurized water
                        evenly
                        during extraction.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h4>Step 3: Preheat and Prime</h4>
                    <p>Before locking in the portafilter, run a blank shot
                        through your espresso machine to preheat the
                        group
                        head and the cup you'll be using. This step is vital as
                        it ensures your espresso is brewed
                        consistently
                        at the optimal temperature, preventing rapid cooling
                        which can adversely affect flavor.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h4>Step 4: Brew Your Espresso</h4>
                    <p>Lock the portafilter into the group head and start the
                        brew cycle immediately to prevent the grounds
                        from
                        burning. Aim for a brew time of 25-30 seconds. As the
                        espresso drips into your cup, you should see a
                        steady, mouse tail-like stream without any sudden
                        spurts or drips. If your machine allows, watch for
                        a
                        brew pressure around 9 bars.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h4>Step 5: Analyze the Shot</h4>
                    <p>Observe the espresso as it brews. The first liquid
                        should appear after about 5-10 seconds and should
                        be
                        dark, flowing into a lighter, golden crema. If the shot
                        pours too quickly or too slowly, adjust your
                        grind size accordingly for your next shot. Taste your
                        espresso; it should have a balance of
                        sweetness,
                        acidity, and bitterness.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h4>Step 6: Clean and Maintain</h4>
                    <p>After every shot, clean your machine to maintain its
                        performance and the quality of your espresso.
                        Rinse
                        the group head, wipe the basket, and purge steam
                        through the wand. Regular maintenance ensures
                        longevity
                        and the most flavorful espresso experience.</p>
